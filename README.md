### What is this?
This was my Algorighm Analysis Group Project for my Data Structures class in the Spring of 2002.

### Project Goal?
The purpose of this project was to calculate and record the speed time complexity of various sorting algorithms to compare their sorting speeds using Big O notation.

### Why is this here?
I designed the interface GenAlgs which the various algorithms implement from so this is a showcase of my design and collaboration with other students.
